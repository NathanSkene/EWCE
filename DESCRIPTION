Description: Used to determine which cell types are enriched within gene lists. The package
        provides tools for testing enrichments within simple gene lists (such as human disease
        associated genes) and those resulting from differential expression studies. The package does
        not depend upon any particular Single Cell Transcriptome dataset and user defined datasets
        can be loaded in and used in the analyses.
