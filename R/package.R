#' EWCE: Expression Weighted Celltype Enrichment
#'
#' Used to determine which cell types are enriched within gene lists.
#' The package provides tools for testing enrichments within simple gene lists
#'  (such as human disease associated genes) and those resulting from
#'  differential expression studies.
