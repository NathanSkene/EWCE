<!-- To modify Package/Title/Description/Authors fields, edit the DESCRIPTION file -->

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}

## Introduction

The *EWCE* R package is designed to facilitate expression weighted cell type
enrichment analysis as described in our *Frontiers in Neuroscience* 
paper [@skene_2016]. *EWCE* can be applied to any gene list. 
 
Using *EWCE* essentially involves two steps:

1. Prepare a single-cell reference; i.e. CellTypeDataset (CTD). Alternatively, 
you can use one of the pre-generated CTDs we provide via the package `ewceData`
(which comes with *EWCE*).  
2. Run cell type enrichment on a user-provided gene list.

## Installation

*EWCE* requires [`R>=4.1`](https://www.r-project.org/) 
and `Bioconductor>=3.14`. 
To install *EWCE* on Bioconductor run:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("BiocManager")){install.packages("BiocManager")}

BiocManager::install("EWCE") 
```

## Documentation 

### [Website](https://`r owner`.github.io/`r pkg`/)  

**NOTE**: This documentation is for the development version of ``r pkg``. See [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/EWCE.html) for documentation on the current release version.  

### [Getting started](https://`r owner`.github.io/`r pkg`/articles/`r pkg`)   

Includes:  

- A minimal example to get started with running *EWCE*. 
- How to install and use the dedicated *EWCE* Docker container usage. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers with the latest version of `EWCE` 
are regularly pushed to 
[Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/neurogenomicslab/ewce).  

### [Extended examples](https://`r owner`.github.io/`r pkg`/articles/extended.html)

Additional tutorials of various *EWCE* features, including how to:  

- Run cell-type enrichment tests 
- Create a CellTypeDataset
- Merge two single-cell datasets 
- Run conditional cell-type enrichment tests
- Apply to transcriptomic data
 
## Updates

Major upgrades to *EWCE* were made in version 1.3.1.
Please see the [NEWS page](https://nathanskene.github.io/EWCE/news/index.html) for more details. 

## Troubleshooting

If you have any problems, please do submit an [Issue here on GitHub](https://github.com/nathanskene/EWCE/issues) with a reproducible example.

## Citation

If you use ``r pkg``, please cite: 

<!-- Modify this my editing the file: inst/CITATION  -->
> `r citation(pkg)$textVersion`

If you use the cortex/hippocampus single-cell data associated 
*EWCE*/*ewceData* this package then please cite the following:

hippocampus revealed by single-cell RNA-seq. Science, 2015.
