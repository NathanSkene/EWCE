# ----- R Package Dockerfile -----
# 
# This Dockerfile is designed for developers of any R package stored on GitHub.
#
# It runs several steps:
#   1. Pulls the official bioconductor Docker container (which includes Rstudio).
#   2. Runs CRAN checks on the R package.
#   3. Installs the R package and all of its dependencies (including Depends, Imports, and Suggests).
#
# This Dockerfile should be used with the [dockerhub.yml](https://github.com/neurogenomics/orthogene/blob/main/.github/workflows/dockerhub.yml) workflow file, 
# as you must first checkout the R package from GitHub, 
# along with several other GitHub Actions.
#
# If the R package passes all checks, the dockerhub.yml workflow will subsequently
# push the Docker container to DockerHub (using the username and token credentials 
# stored as GitHub Secrets).
# 
# You can then create an image of the Docker container in any command line:
#   docker pull <DockerHub_repo_name>/<package_name>
# Once the image has been created, you can launch it with:
#   docker run -d -e ROOT=true -e PASSWORD=bioc -v ~/Desktop:/Desktop -v /Volumes:/Volumes --rm -p 8788:8787 <DockerHub_repo_name>/<package_name>
# Finally, launch the containerised Rstudio by entering the following URL in any web browser:
#   http://localhost:8788/
#
# The username will be "rstudio" by default, 
# and you can set the password to whatever you like, 
#
# This DockerFile was partly adapted from the [scFlow Dockerfile](https://github.com/combiz/scFlow/blob/master/Dockerfile).
